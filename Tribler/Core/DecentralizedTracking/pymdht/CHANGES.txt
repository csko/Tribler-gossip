== 12.2.3

== 12.2.2

- bugfix: boostrap check crash on error message received.

== 12.2.0

- bootstrap_mode available to run a node as bootstrap node. It ignores some
  queries to avoid being added to too many routing tables.
- telnet-like API available with option --telnet-port (see ui/telnet_api.txt)
- Module identifier simplified and cleaned up.
- Added some crawling scripts to run experiments
- IncomingMsg attributed listed for clarity
- Log file is now limited in size (10 MB in nomal mode, 1 GB in debug)

== 12.1.0

- Message is now a factory. Now 'private_dht_name' is a parameter instead of
  an evil global variable
- Lookup cache
- Security: avoid multiple routing table entries with the same IP
- README.txt replaced by README.rst
- Added support for experiment plugin
- Improved graphical visualization

== 11.8.2

- Bugfix: there was no error msg handler in exp_plugin_template.py

== 11.8.1

- Moved all user interface code to ui directory
- Integrated all user interfaces and options in interactive_dht.py
- pymdht_daemon.py is now deprecated (functionality moved to
  interactive_dht.py)
- user can now choose a nodeId (node-id option) or choose a nodeId close to
  some identifier (node-id + log-distance)

== 11.8.0

- Refined all code related to bootstraping.
- Added GUI code (from Shariq)

=== 11.07

- Profiling toolkit integrated (profiler directory)

- Many nodes to bootstrap into the overlay. boostrap.main contains nodes
controlled by us and bootstrap.backup contains nodes we have seen alive for a
long time.

- The default path is now ~/.pymdht. Deleting that directory cleans any state
(it would be as if the code never run before on the machine).  

- TODO: some plugins do not work, need to clean up or fix them

- TODO: if connectivity is lost for a long enough period (1 hour?), all nodes
will be expelled from the routing table. Need to stop expelling nodes when n
timeouts in a row.

=== v1.0, 31 Jan 2011 -- Initial release with proper documentation
