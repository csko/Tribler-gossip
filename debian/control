Description: Python based Bittorrent/Internet TV application
 It allows you to watch videos and download
 content. Tribler aims to combine the ease of
 Youtube.com with the performance of peer-to-peer.
 .
 Tribler is backwards compatible with the Bittorrent
 download protocol. To discover interesting content
 standard RSS feeds with .torrent links are supported
 plus the "Tribe protocol" which automatically scans
 the network for available Bittorrent swarms upon
 startup. Tribler uses an embedded web browser to
 access video clips of Youtube.com and Liveleak.com
 Other features are "People who like this also like"
 for recommending related swarms, the ability to
 make friends, and to donate idle upload capacity
 to friends. The later can improve download speed
 by a factor of two on asymmetric Internet links.
 The fastest way of social file sharing
