func to stop buddycast

+ Fast bootstrapping

	The fixed 15 seconds BuddyCast interval will be made dynamic and vary between 1 and 60 seconds. Buddycast will run into 4 different modes : 
	
	1 second rounds; Bootstrap mode 
	Only used once, the 15 minutes directly after the software is installed.
	
	5 second rounds; Accelerated mode 
	Used 30 minutes directly after the software is restarted. (Also following Bootstrap mode) 
	15 second rounds; Normal mode 
	Default operation 
	60 second rounds; Slow mode 
	Entered when Tribler has been running for more than 24 hours 

Reduce memory usage
	+ keep up to 2K peers
	+ combine self.peers with self.preferences
	
+ New recommendation algorithm

+ User can configure Tribler disk usage
	User can configure Tribler disk place and usage
		Transfer parameter to the core
		GUI support
		Policy of deleting torrents 

+ New message layout
  No preferences in taste buddies; combine taste and random peers to one list and attach their similarity;
  Only include my new preference (+ delete) since last buddycast with that peer
+ Include tracker status in torrent collecting

torrent collecting

replacing of megacache + User can configure the place to save torrents (./collected_torrents)
 (look for old .Trilber->use that; if not found create ./Tribler_data in install dir)
** linux?

Active ping
Automatic Update
Light torrent collecting

incrementally update

----------------------
database update: 
#	PreferenceDB - remove {'relevance': int (0), 'rank': int (0)} 
	PeerDB - add 'last_buddycast'
	ActionDB (RecNo) - record user's actions
